# Saga - color theme

The `Saga` color theme is based on dramatic landscape photos of cold, remote places like Iceland and Alaska. The `Saga` theme colors are pulled from things such as blue glacier waters, green mossy rocks and craggy mountainsides. The theme was built from the ground up and not based on any existing theme. I've been using it primarily for SCSS, CSS, HTML and Vue files but it should work well for most code syntax. Give it a try and I hope you'll be pleasantly surprised.

## Thank you

This is my first theme and it's been an adventure figuring things out. Thank you to Mike at https://themes.vscode.one/ for the Theme Studio VS Code website that made creating a theme a bit less arduous. And thanks very much for trying my theme. Hope you like it.

**Enjoy!**
