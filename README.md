# Saga - color theme

The `Saga` color theme is inspired by the dramatic landscapes of places worthy of epic tales like Iceland and Alaska. The `Saga` theme colors are pulled from photos of craggy mountainsides, green mossy rocks and blue glacier waters. The theme was built from the ground up and I've tried to cover most situations. I've been using it primarily for SCSS, CSS, HTML and Vue files but it should work well for most code syntax. Give it a try and I hope it'll work for you too.

## Thank you

This is my first theme and it's been an adventure figuring things out. Thank you to Mike at https://themes.vscode.one/ for the Theme Studio VS Code website that made creating a theme a bit less arduous. And thanks very much for trying my theme. Hope you like it.
