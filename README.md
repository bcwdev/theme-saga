# Saga - theme

`Saga` is a dark theme based on my love of dramatic landscapes - remote formidable places that inspire epic tales.

The theme has two variations - Nordic & Oceania. Both were built from the ground up through many hours of trial and error. The `Saga` theme colors were pulled from a range of landscape photos and tweaked from there. The theme has been designed to be intuitive and pleasant to use for extended coding sessions.

I've been using it primarily for SCSS, CSS, HTML and Vue and it's particularly well suited for those, but it should work for other code languages as well. Give it a try and I hope it'll work for you too.

## Thank you

This is my first theme and it's been an adventure figuring things out. Thank you to Mike at https://themes.vscode.one/ for the Theme Studio VS Code website that made creating a theme much easier that it would have been. And thanks very much if you give my theme a try. Hope you like it.

**Enjoy!**
