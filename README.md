# Saga - theme

`Saga` is a dark theme based on my love of dramatic landscapes - remote formidable places that inspire epic tales like Iceland and Alaska. 

The theme was meticulously built from the ground up and I've tried to cover most situations. The `Saga` theme colors are pulled from landscape photos of a wide range of environments like craggy mountainsides, green mossy trees and blue glacial waters. 

It has been designed to be intuitive and pleasant to use for extended coding sessions. 

I've been using it primarily for SCSS, CSS, HTML and Vue and it's particularly well suited for those but it should work well for most code languages and syntax. Give it a try and I hope it'll work for you too.

This is my first theme and it's been an adventure figuring things out. Thank you to Mike at https://themes.vscode.one/ for the Theme Studio VS Code website that made creating a theme a bit less arduous. And thanks very much for trying my theme. Hope you like it.
